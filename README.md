# Date night mixed messages
The purpose of this project was to develop my javascript and git/github skills . The program's goal is to develop a random unique message to my partner on what to do for date night (with a random rather ridiculous greeting, compliment and activity choice) via command line.

## Features
- Generate a random date night message.
- Basic command line user interface.
- User input y to generate a message.
- User input n to close application.
- Catch invalid input and ask message again.

## How to use
- Open the project folder from the command line.
- Run command 'node script.js' to execute the program.
- Follow prompt instructions to get random message or close the program.

## Technologies used
- Javascript to write the script
- Node js terminal environment to run the program
- Node readline to command line interface
- Math inbuilt javascript library to randomise the messages
